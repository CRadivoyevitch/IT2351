##Executive Summary
1. A clean refresh of the MySQL interface.
2. Concat took some time to grasp the code correctly, however the result was correct.
3. Understanding the date formating took some effort, but understanding aliases was cemented.
4. Join was very comprehendable and will be advantageous in the future. 
5. Having things come together without much stumbling was rewarding.
6. Ordered and set items up to be joined 
7. Again it was rewarding having all the aspects of prior questions flow together with ease
8. Adding rounded taxes is showing not only how to gather data but also manipulate it, which will be helpful in the future.

##Query Review
At first the interface was completely foreign for me once again due to the time taken between assignments.
I chose to use w3schools and it proved very helpful simply so I could gain an idea of what the code should look like visually. From there it was a matter of trial and error to solidify the concepts. Much of the syntax and intricacies thus far have been intuitive in nature.

##Conclusion
I feel I have a firm understanding of the different syntax, and am navigating the playground of MySQL much better. Now that the tools are usable, I'm curious how future assignments will spark creative thoughts to how I can apply them in the future.
