# Executive Summary
This assignment used applied knowledge of stored procedures. These are coding to write that helps modify a database quicker than individual entries would. While the process does not do wonders for processing speed in larger amounts of data, it can prove cost-effective and a good way to organize the code for others that may read or use it. 

# Stored Programs

### No1
This code was designed to count all the products and declare where it was above 18 or below 18. I relied on the Onenote video provided to understand how to get the needed results. After understanding the format of stored procedures better, the other codes were easier to write. 
### No2
This was intended to add a new row to a dataset, in this case a new instrument category. The Value of this new category needed to be incorporated through a coordinate-type form. after uncovering the programmed failed message due to a 'guitars' category existing already, I created a category of jibberish which was accepted to the database.
### No3
The purpose of this code was to have a chosen item show its discounted price by subtracting the discounted amount from the item price itself. In my code I ran into an error 1418 which wouldn't allow completion. Upon internet search I came across a page that provided code to evade the issue, which I implemented into the code. https://javahowtos.com/122-databases/371-solved-mysql-issue-this-function-has-none-of-deterministic,-no-sql-or-reads-sql-data.html#:~:text=Error%20Code%3A%201418.,to%20use%20less%20safe%20log.) 

# Conclusion
While I found the provided videos and works on One note to be difficult to grasp, through some internet searching the 'aha' moment sure enough came. It helps to remember these table values are vectors and to not overcomplicate the code when creating these stored procedures.
