 #Executive Summary
 This assignment was primarily set to prove one can update and create new tables with a dataset. Using a new set of data cemented the interface knowledge gained from prior assignments.
 
 #Query Review
 I found the easiest thing to do was think intuitively and review areas of interest online while keeping the workshop interface as a guide as well.
 
 #Conclusion
Being able to not only choose the data that I want to see in a easy-to-view table form, but also being able to edit and add to the databases when seen fit is essential to work in the data analytics field. The activities were not overly complicated but still presented a challenge.
