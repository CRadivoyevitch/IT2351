# i. Executive Summary
  This assignment was built to make sure we understood (at an introductory level) the interface of MySQL, how to add databases, and how to manipulate the different tables included in them.
# ii. MySQL Workbench
  Things were difficult to comprehend at first due to brash thinking telling me to skim through the assigned reading. Taking things step by step helped a lot, along with a little bit of trying things until something worked.
# iii. Queries
  Navigating the Queries was not inately intuitive, but after reading the different files on the interface and exploring a little, the work involved with them was not an issue.
# iv. Conclusion
  It wasn't quite clear to me how MySQL would be implemented in my future goals until having a ponder through the assignment. I understand know that it can be a very valuable tool for fields that require gargantuan amounts of data. Whereas before I just figured things could go into an excel sheet, with the ever growing amount of data we collect, this platform will be critical to run with the big dogs.
